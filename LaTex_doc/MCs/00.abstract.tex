\chapter{Abstract}
Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a blooming research area which uses visible light spectrum as the communication channel. Exponential growth of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) deployment as a light source is encouraged to use for communication purposes as well. With the introduction of VLC, LED can be used for communication while providing the primary function of illumination.  Since location-based network access protocols have not been implemented for Wi-Fi devices, this research has been conducted with the intention of using VLC to perform location-based authentication. In our location authentication protocol, VLC technology is used for authentication purpose and Wi-Fi is used for data transfer once the device has been authenticated.  The proposed protocol provides location-based connectivity to Wi-Fi devices with minimum changes to Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) and Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protocol by using VLC.
